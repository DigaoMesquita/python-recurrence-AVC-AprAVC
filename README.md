# AprAVC — Stroke Recurrence Prediction (ML Framework)

AprAVC is a Machine Learning framework designed to support stroke recurrence prediction using real-world clinical data.
The project organizes a unified experimental protocol that integrates: preprocessing, class imbalance handling, training of multiple families of supervised models, and comparative evaluation.

> Objective: to provide a reproducible pipeline for comparing balancing strategies and models using metrics appropriate to the clinical scenario.
